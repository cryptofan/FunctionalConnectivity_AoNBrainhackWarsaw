An entire row of large trees were uprooted in front of the Springfield police chief's home on Kerr Lane.

A large landfill in Mesa was washed away.  The Gillespie Dam west of Phoenix was damaged as high water spread throughout low-lying areas.  Many roads closed and motorists stranded by flooded dips and washes.  Phoenix alone sustained at least $4.2 million in damages from this prolonged period of heavy rains.  This January was the wettest January on record with 5.22 inches at the airport.  It was also the 4th all- time wettest month.  Total rainfall for both December and January was 8.30 inches; this was the greatest ever for any two consecutive months. Arizona experienced its worst flooding in a decade as record rainfall and associated flooding forced many from homes and disrupted business.  The Red Cross reported 678 dwellings destroyed or damaged.  Early estimates of damage were at least $56 million statewide.  A Presidential Federal Disaster Declaration was requested and signed by the President on January 19th. Several storm systems affected the state before the major storm arrived during the night of January 7-8.  Significant precipitation of two to three inches were reported in a few sites between Phoenix and the Mogollon Rim.  Moist low-level flow was forced upward and resulted in heavy rain and snow in the highest elevations.  Periods of heavy rainfall resulted from the interaction of dynamic forcing and convective instability.  The most significant flash flood events occurred when convective rains fell on watersheds already saturated from earlier rainfall.  Another factor contributing to the unusually high runoffs and associated flooding was snow melt.  The snow level during the 6th to the 8th rose to about 8,500 feet, several thousand feet above typical snow levels.  In summary, the combination of a northward-displaced subtropical jet, with its abundant moisture supply and associated disturbances, and a southward-displaced polar jet, with its storm track, led to the abnormally wet period from just after Christmas to mid-January.","CSV"

Most of the storms produced gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and some small hail.  One report of dime-size hail was received from the City of Hampton, in Franklin County.  Another brief period of dime-size hail occurred over western Humboldt County.  Considerable damage was done to one property in Polk City.  Winds blew a pole building out of the ground and caused damage to a few other buildings on the property.  The winds appeared to be the result of a microburst as the top of the thunderstorm collapsed.  For the most part however, damage was minor around the state.","CSV"

A severe squall line raced eastward at 50 mph ahead of an intense low producing several tornadoes and strong downbursts as it moved through the state and directly caused seven fatalities.  This was followed by a hitherto unknown  (for the Gulf Coast) winter storm surge of 9 to 12 feet onto the gulf coast in Taylor County, with storm surges and/or tidal and wind driven flooding of 5 to 9 feet elsewhere along the gulf coast of the state and into the lower Keys.  This was followed by a period of 8 to 12 hours of high sustained winds of up to 50 mph with gusts to 70 mph, keeping tides much above normal along the west coast and causing severe beach erosion in many areas.  Total number of fatalities from the storm was 47, including 14 from storm surge and flooding, seven from tornadoes and/or strong downbursts, and four from high winds in the aftermath of the squall line.  Eleven people drowned offshore in the Gulf of Mexico after strong winds swamped or capsized ships  (including seven crewmen from a 200-foot Honduran freighter).  Eleven others died during rescue operations and cleanup activities.  Meanwhile, colder air poured in behind the intense low with up to four inches of snow falling in the panhandle from north of Pensacola to Crestview, and a trace to 3 inches elsewhere across north Florida.  Record or near record low temperatures occurred over much of the state the following two nights.  Total property damage was estimated at $1.6 billion.","CSV"

Four weak tornadoes occurred in Oklahoma with this outbreak of severe weather.  An F0 tornado occurred 2 miles west of Elk City and knocked down power poles and power lines.  An F0 tornado briefly touched down in an open field in extreme southeast Tillman County 6 miles southeast of Grandfield, with no damage reported.  The third tornado had the longest path of the four.  This tornado traveled along a 5-mile path from 4 miles east of Alex to 3 miles west of Criner.  The tornado was narrowrow (35 yards wide) and produced mainly F0 damage with a small area of F1 damage in McClain County.  The fourth tornado developed after midnight in Lincoln County and moved into Okfuskee County along its 4.5-mile path from two miles southeast of Prague to 2.5 miles west-southwest of Paden.  The tornado was an F1 and averaged 100 yards in width.  The tornado rolled an abandoned bus 75 feet to the east-southeast and lifted a camper trailer 75 feet to the north.  The tornado also tossed an 18-foot horse trailer into a barn, demolishing both structures.  The tornado produced an estimated $250,000 in damage. Large hail also accompanied many of the storms.  Softball-size hail was reported in Texola and near Sayre.  Baseball-size hail fell shortly before 2200 CST and then again after 2300 CST in Waurika.  The large hail in combination with strong winds and flash flooding caused between $250,000 and $500,000 in damage in Waurika.  Numerous other locations in southwest Oklahoma received quarter- to golfball-size hail. Strong winds also caused widespread damage throughout southwest, central, and eastern Oklahoma.  During the evening hours, a very small but intense microburst destroyed a building in Verden.  Damage was estimated at $45,000.  Strong thunderstorm winds near 70 mph blew out windows at several businesses in Frederick and blew a portion of the roof off the Frederick Middle School.  Strong thunderstorm winds blew down a power line near Hammon, and winds estimated at between 70 and 80 mph occurred near Granite.  In Dover, a downburst produced winds estimated at 60 mph which destroyed a mobile home, downed a power pole and some trees and broke off numerous tree limbs up to 10 inches in diameter.  In Okmulgee County, severe thunderstorm winds during the early morning hours of the 30th blew an unoccupied mobile home over 5 miles to the west of Beggs.  Strong winds in Alex broke off tree limbs, downed several power poles, and tore part of a roof off of a house.  High winds from a thunderstorm, severely damaged a sheet metal barn and blew down trees 2 miles south-southeast of Prague.  Winds from severe thunderstorms blew down numerous trees along a path from 2 miles southeast of Prague to 4 miles east of Prague.  Strong winds downed trees 5 miles south of Randlett. Widespread flash flooding was reported with these storms.  High water in Waurika flooded three homes.  One home which was not occupied had about a foot of water flowing through it.  A few other homes in Waurika were sandbagged to help keep flood waters out.  In Cotton County, water was flowing over Highway 36 south of Route 70, over a road 1 to 2 miles south of Randlett, and over a roadway 3 miles south and 0.5 mile west of Devol during the evening hours of the 29th.  Near Comanche travel was reduced to one lane due to water covering Highway 81.  In Jefferson County, high water covered Highway 81 about 2 miles north of Addington.   Lightning strikes also caused damage during these storms.  A  home in Shattuck was struck by lightning.  The fire resulting from the lightning damaged electronic equipment and started a grass fire in the backyard of the home.  A fire from a lightning strike destroyed a trailer 2 miles west of Comanche.  A lightning strike to a home 6 miles north of Waurika resulted in minor damage.  In Quinton, lightning struck and killed several cattle.","CSV"

The tornado was narrowrow (35 yards wide) and produced mainly F0 damage with a small area of F1 damage in McClain County.  The fourth tornado developed after midnight in Lincoln County and moved into Okfuskee County along its 4.5-mile path from two miles southeast of Prague to 2.5 miles west-southwest of Paden.  The tornado was an F1 and averaged 100 yards in width.  The tornado rolled an abandoned bus 75 feet to the east-southeast and lifted a camper trailer 75 feet to the north.  The tornado also tossed an 18-foot horse trailer into a barn, demolishing both structures.  The tornado produced an estimated $250,000 in damage. Large hail also accompanied many of the storms.  Softball-size hail was reported in Texola and near Sayre.  Baseball-size hail fell shortly before 2200 CST and then again after 2300 CST in Waurika.  The large hail in combination with strong winds and flash flooding caused between $250,000 and $500,000 in damage in Waurika.  Numerous other locations in southwest Oklahoma received quarter- to golfball-size hail. Strong winds also caused widespread damage throughout southwest, central, and eastern Oklahoma.  During the evening hours, a very small but intense microburst destroyed a building in Verden.  Damage was estimated at $45,000.  Strong thunderstorm winds near 70 mph blew out windows at several businesses in Frederick and blew a portion of the roof off the Frederick Middle School.  Strong thunderstorm winds blew down a power line near Hammon, and winds estimated at between 70 and 80 mph occurred near Granite.  In Dover, a downburst produced winds estimated at 60 mph which destroyed a mobile home, downed a power pole and some trees and broke off numerous tree limbs up to 10 inches in diameter.  In Okmulgee County, severe thunderstorm winds during the early morning hours of the 30th blew an unoccupied mobile home over 5 miles to the west of Beggs.  Strong winds in Alex broke off tree limbs, downed several power poles, and tore part of a roof off of a house.  High winds from a thunderstorm, severely damaged a sheet metal barn and blew down trees 2 miles south-southeast of Prague.  Winds from severe thunderstorms blew down numerous trees along a path from 2 miles southeast of Prague to 4 miles east of Prague.  Strong winds downed trees 5 miles south of Randlett. Widespread flash flooding was reported with these storms.  High water in Waurika flooded three homes.  One home which was not occupied had about a foot of water flowing through it.  A few other homes in Waurika were sandbagged to help keep flood waters out.  In Cotton County, water was flowing over Highway 36 south of Route 70, over a road 1 to 2 miles south of Randlett, and over a roadway 3 miles south and 0.5 mile west of Devol during the evening hours of the 29th.  Near Comanche travel was reduced to one lane due to water covering Highway 81.  In Jefferson County, high water covered Highway 81 about 2 miles north of Addington.   Lightning strikes also caused damage during these storms.  A  home in Shattuck was struck by lightning.  The fire resulting from the lightning damaged electronic equipment and started a grass fire in the backyard of the home.  A fire from a lightning strike destroyed a trailer 2 miles west of Comanche.  A lightning strike to a home 6 miles north of Waurika resulted in minor damage.  In Quinton, lightning struck and killed several cattle.","CSV"

The damage path was initially about 20 yards wide but spread to about 2 miles wide just before diminishing to a wind speed below severe criteria (where no more damage was found).  A number of eye witnesses reported a small but distinct funnel embedded in the area of the downburst. The tornado seemed to be in the center to northern part of the damaged area.  The small tornado mostly snapped off some trees.  Most of the damage resulted from the downbursts.  A porch was torn off a house at Fairview along with some downed trees.  In the area between Fountain Inn and Owings some billboards were blown down, vinyl siding was blown off a house, a number of trees were downed (some fell on structures and mobile homes), and a few sheds and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed.  Power was off in the area for a few hours.  The hailstorm associated with the storm was impressive in amount but only reached marble-size and therefore caused little if any property damage.  At Union, trees were downed at several locations in the city, a roof was blown off an outbuilding, and parts of the leachers at the county football stadium were destroyed.","CSV"

This storm produced large hail for its entire journey across the upstate.  This hail caused an enormous amount of damage, especially to roofs and vehicles.  The hail piled up to great depths in some places such as Pickens where hail clogged storm drains and caused an urban flood which ruined much of a large store building under construction.  This storm also produced a well defined wall cloud over most of its path and a funnel was associated with the wall cloud as the storm moved south of Pickens, over Easley, and into Greenville.  It has been determined that the circulation reached the ground east of Easley along Highway 123.  There several cars were blown off the road while a ""pipe shaped"" funnel was directly overhead.  The condensation funnel and the main circulation never reached the ground apparently.  From all evidence the tornado could have been quite strong and long-lived had it fully developed.  The largest hail across the upstate was very close to the wall cloud structure.  The most wind damage was in West Greenville where a number of power lines were downed.  The funnel cloud was clearly visible there also but it has not been determined if the rotary wind caused the damage.  The funnel was followed by a number of law enforcement officers for quite a distance across Pickens and Greenville Counties.  A number of trees and power lines were blown down in parts of Spartanburg and Cherokee Counties from the same storm.  A second severe storm followed a few miles behind the first storm.  This storm also produced a great deal of large hail but no wind damage was reported with it.  Lightning set a home in North Spartanburg afire.","CSV"

Damage at the farm included a two-car garage demolished, three grain silos damaged with one silo moved 18 inches off its foundation, a second garage damaged, the slate roof of the main residence partially removed along with the brick chimney. Other areas hard hit by the storms included sections of Ulster and Dutchess counties where trees, power lines and utility poles were downed leaving over 3,000 customers without power.

As the line progressed it turned into a large thunderstorm complex.  Quite a bit of severe weather was associated with the complex while it was to the southwest of Iowa.  As the storms moved into Iowa they weakened and produced mostly heavy rainfall and some small hail (pea to marble-size).  One cell moved into Taylor County.  Two farmsteads were hit by a tornado in the southwest corner of the county.  The tornado touched down in sections 21 and 28 of Polk Township.  Trees were twisted with shingles being driven into the trees.  Damage on one farmstead totaled approximately $70,000 with two garages taken out and damage done to the farmhouse.  The second farm sustained about $35,000 damage with most done to outbuildings.  Reports indicated one piece of tin from the two farmsteads that were hit was found two to three miles away.  The same storm caused damage to grain bins and silos to the southwest of Taylor County in Missouri.  The tornado remained on the ground, at least intermittently, to a point west-northwest of Bedford.  At that point it lifted, just before crossing Highway 2.  The track would have taken the tornado through the town of Gravity.  Fortunately, after it hit the two farmsteads in the southwest part of the county, it tracked across open countryside.","CSV"

This severe weather episode was confined to a very small area.  Three weak tornados were the first severe weather in the episode.  The first tornado developed as the parent thunderstorm grew into a significant storm.  This tornado spun a car around in the highway then lifted.  The same parent storm produced the longest lived tornado of the day.  The storm initially touched down at 1750 EST in the South Cove area of Lake Keowee north of Seneca where it tossed a large boat onto land and damaged several boathouses.  The tornado was clearly visible as a small but classic funnel on the ground and crossing the lake.  The tornado skipped along the ground intermittently for about 5 miles and was last spotted at the community of Keowee near Clemson.  Most damage was downed trees and power lines.  The third tornado in the Upstate came from a severe thunderstorm which also produced severe weather in Georgia.  This tornado was first viewed as a wall cloud and funnel by a trained spotter.  He was not initially able to determine that the storm completely reached the ground (view hindered by trees) but later information revealed that a mobile home was moved off its foundation, and trees were downed, in the specific area where he watched the storm dip down briefly.  The storm eventually developed a long-lived twin funnel configuration which was viewed by a number of people as it crossed the southern part of the city of Anderson.  Localized heavy rainfall caused several streams to overflow in Pickens County.  A number of roads and bridges were under water for a period of time.  The Olenoy River perhaps was the largest stream in flood.  Lightning struck a television transmitter site causing severe damage and knocking the station off the air for almost 6 hours.","CSV"

The tornado moved east-southeast across the lake, becoming a waterspout.  One witness stated that the waterspout pulled up a large quantity of water as it traversed the lake.  On the eastern edge of the lake, the tornado apparently lifted off the ground for about 500 feet and then touched down again farther east before dissipating.  Tree damage was extensive, with several trees twisted, snapped off and uprooted.  Numerous trees were 2 to 3 feet in diameter, with a few of the trees 4 to 5 feet.  The damage suggested that the tornado hugged the northern edge of the lake more closely.  One large portion of a tree was sent through the roof of a nearby house.  Another house was damaged by a 3-foot diameter trunk falling over on its roof.  A wooden boat dock, some 30 feet in length, was completely destroyed and tossed up on the land.  A 10- X 10-foot wooden shed was demolished and its roof lifted and carried about 200 feet away.  Some other observers reported automobiles being moved about by the wind, and large areas of sod being vacuumed off the ground leaving exposed root pits.  Fortunately, there were no known injuries from the storm.","CSV"

Thunderstorm winds overturned a trailer and downed trees near Frederick, damaged a porch in Lawton, downed trees two miles west of Duncan and in Lawton and downed tree limbs on the west side of Duncan.  Golf ball-size hail was reported at Altus Air Force Base and at Tom Steed Lake. Hail of unknownnown size accumulated up to a depth of ten inches just east of Altus.  Isolated severe thunderstorms also developed in northeast Oklahoma during the evening of the 1st and lingered into the early morning of May 2nd.  Numerous locations in Creek County received dime to half dollar-size hail.  Hail as large as golf ball- size fell briefly at Drumright in Creek County.  Torrential rainfall also resulted in flash flooding in Drumright.  Tiger Creek overflowed its banks, and the water from the creek rose 4 1/2 feet over a bridge across State Highway 33 in Drumright.  This resulted in considerable flood damage to five to ten businesses in Drumright, with water as deep as five feet in one business.  One hundred families were evacuated due to the floodwaters. Damage in Drumright was estimated to be $500,000. Water was also over State Highway 16 one mile south of Shamrock for a short period of time.","CSV"

A supercell began the production of severe weather with a long track but weak tornado.  The tornado left a mostly continuous 34-mile path through Greenwood and Laurens Counties.  It began at Bradley in Greenwood County, crossed into Laurens County 10 miles north east of Greenwood at 1540 EST, and dissipated 5 miles south-southwest of Clinton.  The tornado was of F0 intensity with a width of 200 yards in Greenwood County.  Trees and power lines were blown down all along the path with fairly substantial damage in the Southern part of the city of Greenwood.  Chimneys were blown off some houses and large trees fell on some structures.  Not including hail damage, which will not be apparent until later, damage was estimated at $75,000 to $100,000.  In Laurens County the storm became a bit stronger reaching F1 intensity with a path width of 300 yards.  Most damage was around Cross Hill where a couple of mobile homes were damaged (one virtually destroyed), a steeple was blown off a church, and numerous trees were blown down.  Some trees fell on structures.  Damage, without hail considered, was in excess of $50,000.  The hailstorm associated with the supercell was very impressive.  Largest hail  was restricted to the  area very near the tornado with large amounts of marble to dime-size hail falling north of that area.  The tornado lifted before reaching Clinton but thunderstorm winds blew down some trees and power lines, blew shingles off roofs, and enormous amounts of golfball-size hail severely damaged cars and roofs.","CSV"

At the same time, a moderate to strong southerly flow of air developed in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  This flow drew moisture in a shallow layer of moisture northward from the remnants of Hurricane Gert.  Thunderstorms erupted over Kansas and southeast Nebraska, then moved into southwest Iowa.  Heavy rainfall occurred over the southwest counties of the state.  Reports of 1.50 to 2.50 inches of rain were common over a seven county area.  Since soil moisture conditions were at the saturation point, all rainfall quickly ran off causing widespread flash flooding.  Generally speaking, the flooding was fairly minor by this summers standards, but still several roads were overtopped with flood waters.  The storms did produce gusty winds and several reports of pea-size to a little larger hail.  One of the storms did produce larger hail.  A storm which, had reached tops in excess of 60,000 feet at one point, moved into Adams County.  Hail a little larger than quarters pounded an area west of Mount Etna for 30 minutes.  The actual location of most of the hail was in Lincoln Township, the northwest corner, one half mile south of the Cass/Adams County border on county road N28.  Crop damage in the area was extensive.","CSV"

During the evening, an upper level system pushed the front into Iowa, with the front reaching central Iowa by sunrise on the 27th.  Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front.  High winds affected the northwest counties of the state.  One-inch-diameter hail was reported with the storms in O'Brien County at Sanborn.  Shortly after midnight, strong straight line winds in Sanborn blew a police car across the street.  The winds lasted 3 to 3.5 minutes.  A three block area in Hartley had a lot of tree damage, with a 22-inch-diameter ash tree uprooted.  Four buildings had the windows broken out.  A three-stall garage had its roof blown about 100 meters north into a bean field.  A single car garage was completely blown away.  It had its door closed with a car inside the garage.  After the wind stopped, the garage was on the other side of the grove and the car was not scratched.  The garage was destroyed.  Four strands of heavy electrical wire were blown down just north of town.  As the storm moved over Dickinson County, lightning struck a resort house in Arnolds Park.  The house was set on fire.  The fire spread quickly, causing extensive damage to the home.","CSV"

Most of the trees were uprooted, but some up to 18 inches in diameter were snapped.  Twenty acres was damaged in the first touchdown, around 600 acres in the second, and near 400 acres in the third.  The damage pattern of the trees in the area of the second touchdown confirmed the presence of a tornado.  Trees on the north side of the path were thrown south, and the ones on the south side were thrown north.  A troop of 125 scouts was camped near the area of the third touchdown.  No one was injured, but four vehicles were damaged by the uprooted trees.  This accounted for all of the damage.  The camp also experienced the 1.00-inch-diameter hail at this time.

Most of the trees were uprooted, but some up to 18 inches in diameter were snapped.  Twenty acres was damaged in the first touchdown, around 600 acres in the second, and near 400 acres in the third.  The damage pattern of the trees in the area of the second touchdown confirmed the presence of a tornado.  Trees on the north side of the path were thrown south, and the ones on the south side were thrown north.  A troop of 125 scouts was camped near the area of the third touchdown.  No one was injured, but four vehicles were damaged by the uprooted trees.  This accounted for all of the damage.  The camp also experienced the 1.00-inch-diameter hail at this time.

A second brief tornado downed power poles just northeast of Lone Grove.  Strong thunderstorm winds uprooted trees, damaged the library and downed power poles in Lone Grove, broke off eight inch tree limbs four miles west-northwest of Brown and rolled a tractor-semitrailer near Caddo.  Flash flooding from heavy rains washed out a bridge on Route 76 just north of Healdton.  Water covered roads two miles southwest of Cobb and five miles west of Durant.  Heavy rains resulted in street flooding in Durant.  Heavy rains in Ardmore resulted in six inches of water in a movie theater, flooded streets with motorists stranded and 20 cars damaged by water two feet deep at an auto dealership.  A lightning strike started a fire which resulted in an estimated $80,000 in damage to a house in Ardmore.  Lightning knocked out the Durant Police department dispatch radio.","CSV"

A brief F0 tornado destroyed a mobile home and downed several trees three miles northeast of Sayre at 1922 CST.  Another weak tornado developed four miles north-northwest of Cooperton at 2048 CST and moved 0.8 miles east before dissipating.  This F0 tornado tore the roof off of a barn and downed numerous tree limbs.  Strong thunderstorm winds resulted in significant damage on the west side of Bartlesville.  Approximately 60 homes received roof damage, and several businesses including the Bartlesville Inn had windows broken, roofs destroyed, and signs lifted from frames.  A ventilator on top of one business was broken off by the winds.  Trees were uprooted, and three 40 foot electric poles were also downed by the winds.  The winds responsible for the damage in Bartlesville were estimated to be between 80 and 90 miles an hour.   Strong thunderstorm winds downed tree limbs seven miles west of Arnett, nine miles north-northwest of Colony, in and near Hydro, in southwest Oklahoma City, four miles east of Edmond, in Guthrie, in Medicine Park, in Garber, seven miles north- northeast of Medford, eight miles northwest of Carney, in Luther and in Burns Flat.  Thunderstorm winds downed power poles in Garber, Stillwater and five miles south-southeast of Billings.  Thunderstorm winds also uprooted trees four miles west of Cashion and one to three miles east of Carrier, heavily damaged a barn three miles west of Verden, tore roofs off barns in Burns Flat and 6 miles north-northeast of Shattuck, overturned a mobile home 7.5 miles south of Indiahoma and destroyed two barns and a chicken house in Cache.   Heavy rains resulted in flash flooding across most of Kay County which resulted in an estimated $750,000 in damage to bridges.  Several people had to be rescued after they attempted to drive across a flooded road.  A lightning strike resulted in an oil tank battery fire three miles north Edmond.","CSV"

The tornado then proceeded northeasterly to a horseranch, where roofs were blown off some small buildings and extensive damage was done by flying debris, including some very large trees that were snapped off and uprooted.  The tornado next damaged the roof of a house and some nearby structures and then crossed the Willamette River. Passing motorists reported seeing the funnel sucking water up from the river.

A small short-lived tornado briefly touched down 1 mile south of Criner at 1330CST.  This F0 tornado produced minor tree damage.  A tornado developed 0.5 miles northeast of Tishomingo at 1528 CST.  This F0 tornado moved east-northeast and dissipated 2 miles northeast of Tishomingo at 1531 CST.  The tornado damaged trees, blew over truck trailers and blew down and entry gate to a ranch.  The third tornado touched down at 1645 CST on the south side of Bearden and moved east for 1 mile before lifting at 1648 CST.  The tornado passed 1 mile south of the Bearden School and between two widely spaced homes.  This F0 tornado was 50 yards wide and resulted in some tree damage. Strong thunderstorm winds destroyed a barn and damaged several buildings 2 miles west of Cherokee City, Arkansas, overturned a boat and damaged trees near Okmulgee, downed numerous trees from 5 miles northwest of Chewey to Chewey and uprooted trees and downed numerous tree limbs on the west side of Muskogee.  Strong thunderstorms winds downed power lines just northeast of Muskogee and downed tree limbs in Hitchita, Bunch, on several rural roads between Peggs and Tahlequah and at the Sequoyah State Park and Golf Course 6 miles east of Wagoner.  Strong thunderstorm winds downed trees in Noble, destroyed a barn, damaged several roofs, overturned two campers and downed trees in Bradley and damaged two barns and downed trees near Antlers. The thunderstorms also produced heavy rainfall which resulted in flash flooding.  Many county roads were flooded in northern Cherokee County and several rural roads were covered by water west of Eufaula.  An underpass on State Highway 16 in the town of Beggs was underwater, and 71st Street was flooded 3 miles east of Broken Arrow.  Many streets were flooded in Okemah, Bixby and in Muskogee.  Street flooding also occurred in Okmulgee, Henryetta and Stilwell.  A road was barricaded near Stratford as water from Spring Brook Creek overflowed the road following heavy rain.  High water washed out a bridge and broke a water line 2 miles northwest of Cromwell. Lightning started an oil tank battery fire approximately 3 miles north of Walters.","CSV"

More hail damage is likely as the hail accumulated to great depths very quickly and near the tornado track was quite large.   Winds were estimated from 60 to 90 mph in downtown sections where plate glass windows were blown out. There was also considerable damage to trees and power lines along with damage from the wind-driven hail.  Nearer the tornado track damage was more severe with large trees crushing some homes.  Mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, and a couple of houses lost roofs from the wind.  The large hail quickly clogged storm drains and an estimated 2 to 3 inches of rain fell causing $50,000 in water damage to equipment in the hospital.

The high winds along the Wasatch Front downed many power lines.  A microburst damaged a greenhouse in a nursery and garden center in Farr West.  Debris from the greenhouse then flattened the shrubs and bedding plants inside.  The owner estimated the damage at $30,000 to $40,000.  Several houses close to this area also had some wind damage in their yards. One of these thunderstorms produced a tornado.  Erda is five miles north of Tooele.  The tornado first tore off the top of an electric pole then moved into a drive-in theater.  It totally destroyed the movie screen.  The tornado then tipped a mobile home over before it moved into an open field, and went back into the clouds.  A few windows on the mobile home were broken.  The movie screen was worth $50,000, and will have to be replaced.  Many objects including a small camper shell, trash barrels, and a wood pile were only blown a short distance or not even disturbed.  The mobile home was located behind a not so sturdy metal building.  That building was not damaged.  Trees surrounding a nearby house were also not damaged.  This event was witnessed by a woman who lived next to the drive-in.  The woman said, ""That she saw the screen being twisted in a whirling motion"".","CSV"

The tornado then struck the Hatfield area where it destroyed or damaged a number of homes.  The tornado continued moving northeastward and struck the southwest part of Mena.  In Mena, a large number of homes and businesses sustained damage.  Most of the buildings that were struck were either destroyed or received major damage.  Eleven people in Mena were treated for minor injuries.  A local park in Mena lost a number of large trees.  Some of these trees were over 100 years old.  A number of buildings in Mena were damaged as a result of trees falling on the structures.  The tornado finally lifted about three miles northeast of Mena, in the community of Hillcrest, where it destroyed a few mobile homes and damaged several others.

Moisture was somewhat limited, however surface dew point temperatures pooled ahead of the front and reached the middle 60s.  During the late afternoon hours, a narrow line of scattered thunderstorms developed.  Many of the storms produced gusty winds and pea to marble-size hail.  Most of the individual cells were fairly short lived.  A few of the cells did produce severe weather.  These cells were the ones that were somewhat isolated, thus had less competition for available moisture.  One cell that became severe was over central Iowa.  Three-quarter inch diameter hail fell in the Ames area, with golf ball-size hail falling farther east in the Nevada and Colo areas.  All of these were in Story County.  A funnel cloud was observed with this cell both southwest of Nevada and also at Colo.  Another severe cell was in the Waterloo area.  Hail of three-quarter inch diameter fell in the Waterloo area, and a funnel cloud was observed over the southeast part of the city.  Three-quarter inch diameter hail also fell north of Brandon in Buchanan County.  Lightning struck two places in Waterloo.  One was at the communications center, where lightning damaged telephone and computer equipment.  The second strike was at a house.  Damage was limited to a few electrical appliances and the central air unit.","CSV"

One elderly lady stated that her dog became restless and started barking 20 minutes before the tornado struck her home.  Continuous lightning was observed by several residents prior to and after the tornado touchdown.   Several cars were destroyed by fallen trees or wind blown debris.  Most of the trees downed by the tornado winds were 60 to 70 feet tall Southern Pine.  Most trees were snapped in half and laid to rest in a general northeast direction. Property damage estimates topped $12 million dollars. The tornado stayed on the ground most of its lifetime and varied in width from one-quarter to one-half mile.
